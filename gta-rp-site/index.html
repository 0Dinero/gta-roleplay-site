            However if you are looking for a roleplaying-server right now, then you dont need to look further
            choose your roleplaying community wisely, 
            choose a roleplaying-server with serious, experienced and good developers, 
            choose a roleplaying-server with an excellent staff-team that together does an amazing job, 
            choose a roleplaying server with a friendly and fun community, choose New York RP.</span>
            <br><br>
            New York RP is the biggest and best roleplaying-server and or community for many reasons
            for example some servers are more hardcore than others 
            regarding the amount of immersion they expect you to provide, however here at New York RP we only
            require you to follow simple and basic rules so the RP will go along more smoothly
            and so that we dont have to think about rules all the time which could potentially ruin the RP 
            <br><br>
            These are the following rules we require you to know and abide by: 
            do not break character or engage in senseless violence, do not COPBAIT which means 
            that you try on purpose to get the police after you for fun, do not FARM which means 
            that you dont join the server for the only purpose of playing GTA which is earning money,
            do not backseat-moderate which means that you cannot go around and threaten players 
            with all sorts of punishments because you feel like you werent treated fairly, Do not
            break FEARRP which means that you have to fear for your life at all times for example 
            if somebody is threatening you with a pistol you gotta obey whatever request the gunman has.
